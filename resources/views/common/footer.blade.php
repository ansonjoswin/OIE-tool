                        Welcome to the Peer-Based Benchmarking Tool for Higher Ed (“PBBT”). The services available through this website (the “services” and the “site”) are provided by the Office of Institutional Effectiveness (“OIE”) at the University of Nebraska Omaha (“UNO”).  The PBBT utilizes data published by the US Department of Education’s National Center of Education Statistics through the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (“IPEDS”).
                        These terms and conditions (this “Agreement”) govern your use of the services. By using the services, you are bound by this Agreement, whether you are a visitor, which means that you simply browse the site or any of its applications, or you are a user with a registered account (“registered user”). UNO-OIE may at any time in its sole discretion (i) modify this Agreement and such modification shall be effective once posted to the site, (ii) change the site, including eliminating or discontinuing any services or other features of the site; and/or (iii) deny or terminate your use of and/or access to the site.
                        </p><p>The term “user” refers to any visitor to the site or registered user, unless provided otherwise. You are only authorized to use the services if you agree to abide by all applicable laws and this Agreement. If you wish to become a registered user, communicate with other users, and make full use of the services, you must read this Agreement and indicate your acceptance during the registration process.
                        Scope
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        The content, documentation, code and related materials made available to users through PBBT is subject to these terms. Access to or use of PBBT services or its content constitutes acceptance of this Agreement as well as any published modifications of the Agreement in the future.
                        Secondary Use

                      <p>
                        As this site relies on data and its different versions as provided by IPEDs, UNO-OIE cannot vouch for the quality and timeliness of any analyses conducted with retrieved data.
                        While OIE makes every effort to accurately analyze and present IPEDS data, UNO-OIE Is not responsible for the integrity, accuracy, or reliability of IPEDS data or its representation on our site.

                        UNO-OIE and the University of Nebraska are not affiliated with or sponsored by IPEDS. Users are responsible for their own activities in connection with the website, including the use of its services. Users are responsible for knowing and complying with all federal, state and local rules, regulations, and laws.

                        PBBT access may be subject to certain limitations as set forth within this Agreement or as UNO-OIE may determine otherwise. If UNO-OIE reasonably believes that a user has attempted to exceed or circumvent these limits, that user's access to the PBBT may be temporarily or permanently blocked.
                        UNO-OIE may monitor use of its services to improve the service or to ensure compliance with this Agreement.

                        Indemnification
                        The user agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the University of Nebraska, its contractors, employees, agents, and the like from and against any and all claims and expenses including attorney’s fees, arising out of your use of the PBBT, including but not limited to violation of this Agreement.
                        Miscellaneous
                        This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between UNO-OIE and the user concerning the subject matter hereof, and may only be modified by the posting of a revised version on this page by UNO-OIE.

                        Do we use 'cookies'?
                        Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.
                        We use cookies to:
                        •	Understand and save user's preferences for future visits
                        •	Collect non-personally identifiable data to analyze traffic to the website, via Google Analytics services – for more information, see below section titled “Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?”
                        You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Since all browsers are a little different, look at your browser's Help Menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookie settings.
                        If you turn cookies off, some features may be disabled.

                        California Online Privacy Protection Act
                        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
                        According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:
                        Users can visit our site anonymously.
                        Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.
                        Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.
                        You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:

                        How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?
                        We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
                    </p>

                        Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?
                        We do allow third-party behavioral tracking via Google Analytics services.
                        Google Analytics
                        We utilize the Google Analytics service to collect non-personally identifiable data to analyze traffic to the website.
                        For more information regarding the data collected via Google Analytics services, see “How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps” (www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

                        When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
                        We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
