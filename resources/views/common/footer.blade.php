                    If you are a copyright owner or authorized agent and believe that your work has been copied and posted on the Services in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or if you believe that your rights have otherwise been violated by the Services, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):

                    (i) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest or the person whose rights have been violated;
                    (ii) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed or the particular rights violated;

                    Our designated (“Copyright Agent”) to receive notifications of claimed infringement is <>, who may be contacted by email at legal@unomaha.edu or by mail at <>. If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your User Content, you may send a counter-notice pursuant to the DMCA containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:

                    (i) your physical or electronic signature;
                    (ii) identification of the User Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the User Content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
                    (iii) a statement that you have a good faith belief that the User Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the User Content; and
                    (iv) your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address, a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in Nebraska, and a statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

Also, you should be skeptical about information provided by others, and you acknowledge that the use of any User Content on this Site is at your own risk.

                    If you become aware of misuse of the Services by any person, please contact UNO at legal@unomaha.edu.

                    You agree to indemnify and hold UNO, and its subsidiaries, and affiliates, and their respective officers, agents, partners and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the Site and Services in violation of this Agreement and/or arising from a breach of this Agreement and/or any breach of your representations and warranties set forth above and/or if any User Content posted on the Site or through the Services causes UNO to be liable to another third party or User.

                    8. Privacy.

                    You agree to the terms of the UNO Privacy Policy, as it may be updated from time to time, a copy of which is posted on the Site.</p>

                    <p>9. Links to Other Sites.

                    The Site may contain links to web sites not operated or maintained by UNO. These links are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by UNO of the contents of such third party web sites. UNO is not responsible for the content of the sites of others and makes no representation regarding the content or accuracy of materials on such sites. If you decide to access linked third-party web sites, you do so at your own risk, and waive any and all claims against UNO regarding the inclusion of links to outside web sites or your use of those web sites.

                    10. Disclaimers.

                    DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES: UNO DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SITE OR SERVICES WILL OPERATE ERROR-FREE OR THAT THIS SITE AND ITS SERVER ARE FREE OF COMPUTER VIRUSES AND/OR OTHER HARMFUL MATERIALS. IF YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR THE SERVICES RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR SERVICING OR REPLACING EQUIPMENT OR DATA, UNO IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE COSTS. THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. UNO, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTIES RIGHTS, AND THE WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE. UNO MAKES NO WARRANTIES ABOUT THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, OR TIMELINESS OF THE SERVICES.

                    DISCLAIMER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES: EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER UNO NOR THE UNO ENTITIES OR THEIR DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS, CONTENT PROVIDERS, AFFILIATES OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, ARISING FROM THE USE OF THIS SITE AND SERVICES, EVEN IF THE PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                    REMEDY: IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES, YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY SHALL BE TO CEASE USING THE SERVICES.

                    Some U.S. states and foreign countries do not permit the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties or liability for certain categories of damages. Therefore, some or all of the limitations above may not apply to you to the extent they are prohibited or superseded by state or national provisions. UNO makes no representation of any kind with respect to the applicability and enforceability of laws or policies of countries other than the United States over the content of this site and the provisions of this Agreement.

                    11. Dispute Resolution.

                    This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and governed by the laws of the State of Nebraska, USA, without reference to its laws relating to conflicts of law. Venue for all disputes arising under this Agreement shall lie exclusively in the District Courts of the State of Nebraska in Douglas County or the Federal District Court of the District of Nebraska (as permitted by law) and each party agrees not to contest the personal jurisdiction of these courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, UNO shall have the right to commence and prosecute any legal or equitable action or proceeding before any non-U.S. court of competent jurisdiction to obtain injunctive or other relief.

                    12. Other Miscellaneous Terms.

                    Should any clause of this Agreement be found unenforceable, wherever possible this will not affect any other clause and each will remain in full force and effect. UNO’s failure to expressly enforce any provision of this Agreement does not waive its rights to enforce that or any other provision. UNO may assign, transfer, or delegate this Agreement or any right or obligation or remedy hereunder (in whole or in part) in its sole discretion.

                    13. IPEDS Regulations / Other Regulations.

                    UNO is in no way affiliated with or sponsored by IPEDS. You are responsible for your own activities in connection with the Site, including your use of the Services. Accordingly, you are responsible for knowing and complying with the IPEDS’s rules, regulations, and laws or other similar rules, regulations, and laws (collectively, “b”). UNO is not responsible if you do not abide by government regulations (or any other similar rules or regulations) in connection with your use of the Site, and/or Services. If you act in violation of government regulations, UNO may take reasonable steps in response, including, but not limited to, termination of your access to and use of the Site and/or reporting of such conduct to IPEDS, the authorities, or other appropriate entity.
